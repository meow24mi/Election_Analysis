## Analysis Summary
The script written for this analysis can be applied to future elections for easy and quick analysis with the same parameters. This script is dynamic and applicable for more than three candidates in more than three counties. There can be adjustments made to accodomate for additional candidates running for alternative offices. With the information about the voters we can also calculate voter turnout based on number of registered voters in these counties.
